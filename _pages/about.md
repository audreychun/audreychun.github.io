Hi! I'm Audrey, a fourth-year Computer Science and Data Science undergraduate at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). My research questions lie at the intersection of AI, deep learning, and medicine. In the past, I worked in the [Sotiras Lab](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/computational-imaging-research-center-circ/labs/sotiras-lab/) within [Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/) at [WashU Medicine](https://medicine.wustl.edu/) in St. Louis on semi-supervised clustering methods to characterize the neuroanatomical heterogeneity of HIV. I went on to the [Gevaert Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/gevaertlab.html) at [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/) to work on integrative AI modeling for precision breast cancer prediction.

my background and history
======
Born and raised in the beautifully forested [Portland Metro Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon), I graduated at the [top of my class](https://www.westlinntidings.com/news/we-are-not-boxes-on-a-screen-now-we-are-a-sea-of-green-and/article_ea2be376-d7da-5e85-93aa-940adceb5ca8.html) from [West Linn High School](https://www.wlwv.k12.or.us/wlhs) in 2021. 

just for fun
======
I dabble in [photography](https://capturedbydree.pixieset.com/), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
