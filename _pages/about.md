Hi! I'm Audrey, a fourth-year Computer Science and Data Science undergraduate at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of AI, deep learning, and medicine.

my work and research
======
During my undergraduate career, I worked in the [Sotiras Lab](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/computational-imaging-research-center-circ/labs/sotiras-lab/) within [Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/) at [WashU Medicine](https://medicine.wustl.edu/) in St. Louis on semi-supervised clustering methods to characterize the neuroanatomical heterogeneity of HIV. I then joined the [Gevaert Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/gevaertlab.html) at [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/) in Summer 2024 to work on deep learning reconstructions of 3D digital breast tomosynthesis from 2D mammography for resource-limited regions. Currently, I'm zooming in from imaging to molecular work in the [Song Lab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/group.html) at UC Berkeley, developing a cross-protein transfer learning model for variant effect prediction. 

my background and history
======
Born and raised in the beautiful [Portland Metro Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon), I attended [West Linn High School](https://www.wlwv.k12.or.us/wlhs) and graduated at the [top of my class](https://www.westlinntidings.com/news/we-are-not-boxes-on-a-screen-now-we-are-a-sea-of-green-and/article_ea2be376-d7da-5e85-93aa-940adceb5ca8.html) in May 2021. I began my studies at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) in Fall 2021.

just for fun
======
I dabble in [photography](https://capturedbydree.pixieset.com/), as well as carry a vlog camera sometimes. I like to [run long distances](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/543903770), bike, and swim. Always happy to go on a run, ride, or grab coffee - feel free to reach out!
