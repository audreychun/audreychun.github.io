Hi! I'm Audrey, a fourth-year Computer Science and Data Science undergraduate at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). My research questions lie at the intersection of AI, deep learning, and medicine. In the past, I worked in the [Sotiras Lab] (https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/computational-imaging-research-center-circ/labs/sotiras-lab/) within [Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology] (https://www.mir.wustl.edu/) at [WashU Medicine] (https://medicine.wustl.edu/) in St. Louis on semi-supervised clustering methods to characterize the neuroanatomical heterogeneity of HIV. I went on to the [Gevaert Lab] (https://med.stanford.edu/gevaertlab.html) at [Stanford Medicine] (https://med.stanford.edu/) to work on integrative AI modeling for precision breast cancer prediction. 

my work and research
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

my background and history

just for fun

I dabble in [photography](https://capturedbydree.pixieset.com/), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
